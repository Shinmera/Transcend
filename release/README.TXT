You need to have a Java Runtime installed for this to work.

To run Transcend, execute the transcend.jar with the Java Runtime.
Usually, double clicking the file should work. If it does not, right click it
and choose "open with.." and then look for an entry of the Java Runtime.

Alternatively there are shell and batch scripts that should run the file.
For windows, run the run.bat, for *nix and Mac Os X, launch the run.sh file.
If neither of those work, open up a terminal or command prompt and enter "java".
If it outputs something similar to "command not found",
then the Java Runtime isn't installed properly.
